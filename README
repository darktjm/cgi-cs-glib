This is another sample using my literate build system.  It is a
library for doing CGI programs in C using GLib and ClearSilver.  It
was a work in progress when I abandoned due to lack of a need any
more.  It was intended to support a dynamic WebDAV interface to a file
service, as well as plain interfaces to other utilities.
